## 🧠 Objective

- **Middle-Aged Customers Dominate**: Most bike purchases come from the middle-aged group.
- **Short Commutes**: People traveling 0–1 miles are the most likely to buy a bike.
- **Education**: Can be explored through slicers to see its influence.

## 🔧 Data Cleaning & Transformation

Data cleaning was performed in Excel:

- Removed **duplicates** and **null values**
- **Paraphrased** inconsistent values in the *Commute Distance* column for cleaner analysis (e.g., "0-1 mi", "0 to 1 miles" → standardized)
- Created a new column:  
  **`Age Bracket`** = Categorized ages into:
  - `Adolescent` (below 30)
  - `Middle Age` (30–55)
  - `Old` (above 55)
